Problem Solving and Software Design

# OIM3640 Project Proposal

**1. The Big Idea:** Our project will aim to extract information from multiple media sources based on what parameters a user enters into our search bar. Our goal will be to allow users to search a broad range of topics that will source data from social media sites such as Twitter or news sites such as the BBC. While we have our eyes set on a broad range of sites to pull from, a minimum viable product would be a website that can extract information from at least two sites. A stretch goal of ours would be to have the website be able to aggregate data with multiple search fields (e.g. a person and a place, as opposed to just a person or just a place).

**2. Learning Goals:** Our first and foremost learning objective will be to learn how to use Python in a tangible, real-world way, as opposed to just self-contained coding. Working on this project will expose us to coding practices and teamwork behaviors that go beyond the basics of the classroom and offer a sample of what could be accomplished with code in a real work environment. Secondly, we hope that our problem solving skills will be improved through Python as we learn more about the language and deal with the trials and tribulations of coding, making mistakes, and correcting those mistakes.

**3. Implementation Plan:** In order to picture roughly what we want our project to look like, inspiration was gained from the “List” function on Twitter, which aggregates tweets on a specific topic or from certain accounts. In order to accomplish something similar (except aggregating from multiple web sources), we will need to learn and adequately understand the process of web scraping in order to obtain our desired data. To do this we will need to better understand the intricacies of the search function on each of the social media sites that we plan to use for data sourcing. Since each platform serves a different purpose, each stream of information is likely to have its own particular search nuances. Lastly, we will need to figure out how to design a proper website for the purpose of hosting our search aggregator.

**4. Project Schedule:** While our schedule will be shaped by the deadlines the professor provides for future milestones, a rough outline will look like the following:
* Week 1: Design & Code Review
* Week 2: Design & Code Review
* Week 3: Website up
* Week 4: Unrefined Design/Code to Source Information from platforms; Mid-Project Presentation
* Week 5: Have data pulled from one platform
* Week 6: Have data pulled from multiple platforms
* Week 7: Almost finalized product; If Time: Work on trying to pull multiple topics from same search
* Week 8: Code Submission, Final Demo & Presentation

**5. Collaboration Plan:** When we have our portion delegated to us, each of the group members will code separately on our own first, then meet once or twice a week for editing and confirming our codes. We will work the necessary hours to make sure the job is completed on time. We may sometimes pair programs on parts we are stuck on but work independently for the most part. In order to prevent any miscommunication or difference in codes, each member will notify on slack when each part is committed and pushed. As a group, we will check in with Professor Zhi Li on project milestones.

**6. Risks:** All three members are currently working in a stressful environment with tight deadlines for many group projects. We currently think that time is the biggest risk as the team needs to find availability to meet with each other and to work on the code independently. Additionally, problems with debugging and not understanding certain coding issues will also present a hurdle that could slow the project down.

**7. Additional Course Content:** Every member possesses basic coding knowledge for website building and design. Also, knowledge gained from learning about creating a web app and debugging will assist us on the way. Although we have not learned about it yet, we believe that web scraping skills will also help our project.
